Scratch is a website that helps young kids start coding with blocks that they connect to create projects. All you do is create projects and share them with the community. That's what I thought when I started Scratch. And I have realized that there is so much more than just making projects
I created this project because Scratch turned 15. This website is older than me and older than millions of kids that are on the website.
Now, let's get started. My journey on Scratch has been incredible and it has been crazy. I have been getting lots of attention mainly because I am in the forums a lot and I like to help the community. But I wasn't always like this. We have to go back to the past. This is like a backstory to a superhero, but I am no super. Just an average kid.
When I started Scratch in 2020, I wasn't as smart with Scratch compared to my knowledge today. I didn't know what to do and I was generally confused. This was the first actual account that I created. I created another account a few years back but it was a shared account between friends. And it was stupid. It had no purpose. So I did what I would most likely do on a social media platform. I tried to get fame
Now, before you go to the comments and say "oh, I thought you didn't care about fame!", I am talking about me right now. I never said that I didn't care about fame from the beginning. I stopped caring about 8 months after I created my account
All right, back to the story. I didn't know what to do, so I decided to get fame, as most people did at the time. It was 2020, so many people were on Scratch, and therefore, more opportunities. So I created the most basic game, which was a clicker game, and I advertised it to many projects. People didn't like it so I stopped... after a month or so. That project has 500 views when I am creating this project, but is it really worth it? Are they real views?
Shortly after, I decided to make more low-quality projects that were funny, waiting for views. I didn't know how hard it was to get views, considering that this was a kids' site, where you can trick people easily. Now, that was in my past. I may or may not have been a little troublemaker, but I changed my ways.
I started getting more attention and I was happy. I didn't really interact with the community because I didn't know about the ENTIRE community. Just the studios and comments. I didn't know about the forums which is a big part of this story.
So I kept making these projects and I actually thought about what I was making. I had to make something with some type of effort put into it. So I did. I created a Pong game and I put effort into it. I didn't advertise at all. That game got 200 views.
And then 2021 came. 2021 was a good year for some people, and I am part of that group. I started off with more followers and I was trying to get a lot of followers but I was wondering how to do this.
So I was looking around Scratch, inspecting projects, and seeing how they got popular. And it was lots of effort and time, which I didn't have. So I thought about Scratch and wondered if it was a good thing to do.
And then came April. April 2021 was a good month for me because I got introduced to the forums through a Turbowarp link. Everything was so new to me. And I thought "Hey, what if I get followers here?"
And so I did. I started off advertising my projects and then I decided to go on the Requests forum and I saw that there were shops there, and they had lots of views. My brain thought that this can bring lots of views easily. So I created two shops that I don't want to mention because of how embarrassing they were. I closed them down shortly after because I lacked the resources.
So what did I do? I went back to making projects and isolating myself from the community. I created another big project called Battle Bros and did okay. It got 100 views. And then I started working on one of the biggest collaborations on the Scratch Forums. Of course, I did it on my own because I didn't want to interact with the community. AspectOS changed my life. The first version was good according to me and I posted it. If I told my past self that this project was going to get noticed by tons of people, I wouldn't have believed it.
And then I took a break. Summer was here and I decided to take a break from Scratch. And then I came back in July of 2021 to do more content. Of course, everything felt weird because of some updates but other than that, it was normal.
I decided to go back into the forums and I interacted with the community. I worked in some shops and I helped with orders. It was pretty ordinary for a person like me at the time. Just working to start my life. Except this was an online life
And then September hit. I thought that creating a collaboration of an already existing project would be great, so I created that thread. I asked people with lots of posts on the forum to join this. Little did I know that I would be the one with the most posts.
Anyways, I decided to dedicate my life to this. I canceled projects to work on this OS and I had wonderful people working with me. At this point, I was happy and I decided to get rid of the past. I didn't care about the fame at this point. I just cared about these memories and I didn't want to let go of them.
And this was my dream. I always wanted to create a team of people and I did! I was so happy and I thought everything about my Scratch journey was complete! But this was only the beginning. Because I would move on to other threads after a while. Questions About Scratch and Suggestions were my next targets and I started to go there to answer some questions
I didn't know much about the forums so, of course, I broke some rules. Today, I have improved and I am better with forum rules. But I sucked at foruming back then. With about 1500 posts, I thought I was a good forumer.
Then I got scared. I got introduced to one of the more stressful and heart-stopping studios. The Forum Helpers. I had seen people with more posts than I did, and I thought about the forums. Was I not a good forumer. These people were wonderful forumers and that brought me down. I wondered if I was ever good enough for foruming. But I ignored that and I kept going. I didn't care about the Forum Helpers. They were off of my mind. I decided to keep going with my collaboration
Eventually, I earned more posts every month. I went from 1500 to 2000. And then I went to 3000, and then I went to 4000 posts. I was getting better at foruming and it was amazing! I was really doing it! And then I came back to the Forum Helpers. This studio didn't scare me and I applied. And with my confidence, I got accepted. But this doesn't mean I am a master forumer. Nothing changed, to be honest. I was just in another studio...
And here I am now. I have 5500+ forum posts and I am always helping the community. I am also continuing with AspectOS and most of the original team is still there. So what do I have to say to Scratch about this? Thank you. Thank you, Scratch for bringing me all of this. I cannot believe that I have gone so far and all of the friends that I have made. For everything in my life. You were the best back then when I used to play Scratch games, and you are the best right now as I continue to create content for about 250+ followers.
And what do I have to say to the community? Keep trying. If you feel demotivated, don't. I have been there and you will eventually find something to do. I know you will. All you have to do is keep trying. Keep being you. Keep sharing your thoughts and interacting with the community. And if you haven't already, then start!
And that is it. I just wanted to share my thoughts about Scratch and how it has changed my life. I cannot wait to see how Scratch will be in the future and how I will be in the future. Things can change and one day, something surprising can happen to me! Thank you to everybody who watched this project. I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day. All right, goodbye.
